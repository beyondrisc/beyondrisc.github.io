            <h3>Devices people can trust</h3>
            <p>We see a world in which people can buy a device for their home, factory or airplane and trust that it will work - now and in the future.</p>

            <div class="hidden">
                <p>This means eliminating issues in security, reliability and robustness, such as 'buffer overflows', which cause 70% of C++ problems annually.</p>

            <h3>Scaling in every direction</h3>
            <p>We want to enable advances in computer science to reach every device - big, small, mobile or otherwise. </p>

                    This is creating a plethora of problems from lack of suitable software developers, to recurring security issues that should have been eliminated two decades ago.

            <h3>Security built-in</h3>
            <p>We deliver security without performance losses and that we can formally prove is correct. We've started with memory safety - the cause of 70% of issues in IoT device software.</p>

            <div class="hidden">
                <p>Our security features are enforced and proven at the hardware level. It's the only way to be sure that these issues are fully eliminated.</p>

            <h3>Modern languages everywhere</h3>
            <p>Programming languages have come a long way in the last 25 years. They significantly improve productivity, accessibility, maintainability and security. We want every developer to have access to these improvements.</p>

            <div class="hidden">
                <p>There's also a growing skills shortage for developers of older languages, like C/C++, that are currently needed for IoT development. By making modern languages available for IoT, we can help companies avoid this.</p>

## Security built-in and enforced

Today's internet of things devices are wildly insecure and untrustworthy. We're not just worried about hackers - 
people need to be able to rely on their devices to keep working, even in new environments.

    <h1>Roadmap</h1>

    <h2>Today - Seed fund</h2>

    <p>Our seed fund of Â£1m will enable us to expand our team to 7 people and produce a prototype silicon chip.</p>

    <h2>12-months - Platform samples</h2>

    <p>By the end of the first year we will have demos built with several partners running on our prototype chip. We will be ready to move to production. Our team will have grown to 10 people, including engineers, operations, marketing and sales.</p>

    <h2>18-months - Platform production</h2>

    <p>With Series A funding and a team of 16 people we will tape-out our chip for production and begin selling our platform as an alternative to Arduino through international distributors. This will establish a wide base of engineers and students using our technology.</p>

    <h1>Where we started</h1>

    <p>Two of our founders started by asking a key question:</p>

    <h2>Why are there so many layers of memory management in modern systems?</h2>

    <p>We realised the upper-most layer could be brought down into the processor hardware. After over 3 years of research into architecture, performance optimisations and correctness proofs, we've refined and prototyped our technology. We're now working full-time on commercialising it.
    </p>

    <p>Our discovery is not only how to place this memory management into hardware, but also how to enforce memory 
    safety across the whole system. This brings a step change in system design, particularly for embedded and IoT devices. 
    </p>

    <p>BeyondRISC spun out of the University of Bristol in July 2019, founded by Ed Nutting, Andres Amaya Garcia and Professor David May.</p>
