title: Our vision

### Devices people can trust

Our vision is a world in which people can buy a device for their home, factory or airplane and trust that 
it will work - now and in the future.

This means fully eliminating well-known issues in security, reliability and robustness. We believe this
is only possible using hardware - the level at which designers can enforce correctness and safety.

### Scaling in both directions

Our vision is to enable advances in computer science to reach every device - big or small. 

Small devices, such as Internet of Things devices, are particularly far behind with programming language support. 
This is creating a plethora of problems from lack of suitable software developers, to recurring security issues
that should have been eliminated two decades ago.

# Our mission

### Modern languages on every device

### Security built-in and enforced

Today's internet of things devices are wildly insecure and untrustworthy. We're not just worried about hackers - 
people need to be able to rely on their devices to keep working, even in new environments.

# Roadmap

### Today - Seed fund

### 12-months - Platform samples

### 18-months - Platform production

# Where we started

Two of our founders started by asking a key question: 

#### Why are there so many layers of memory management in modern systems?

We realised the upper-most layer could be brought down into the processor hardware. After over 3 years of research
into architecture, performance optimisations and correctness proofs, we've refined and prototyped our
technology. We're now working full-time on commercialising it.

Our discovery is not only how to place this memory management into hardware, but also how to enforce memory 
safety across the whole system. This brings a step change in system design, particularly for embedded and IoT devices. 

BeyondRISC spun out of the University of Bristol in July 2019, founded by Ed Nutting, Andres Amaya Garcia and Professor David May.
